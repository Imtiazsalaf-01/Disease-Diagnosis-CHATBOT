# Disease Diagnosis Chatbot

# @ MANAC INFOTECH Pvt Ltd  -- 6 weeks internship --
**MINOR PROJECT**

Backend of a simple chatbot that can diagnose disease based on symptoms given by the user. It uses NLP to tokenize and lemmatize text input, vectorize it with term frequency and inverse document frequency to find similarity with diseases in the knowledge base. The knowledge base consists of diseases along with their symptoms. Disease with highest similarity is presented to the user.

In conclusion, the "Disease Diagnosis using Chatbot" project offers an accessible and user
centric approach to preliminary healthcare guidance. The integration of chatbot technology 
streamlines the symptom-checking process, empowers users with information, and encourages 
responsible healthcare decisions.The future of disease diagnosis using chatbots holds immense 
potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by offering accessible, personalized, and efficient 
medical assistance to individuals worldwide. By leveraging advances in AI, NLP, and healthcare 
technology, chatbots can contribute significantly to improving patient outcomes, reducing 
healthcare costs, and enhancing overall quality of care.

# FUTURE SCOPE 

The future scope of disease diagnosis using chatbots is promising, with several opportunities for 
advancement and innovation. As artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing 
(NLP) technologies continue to evolve, chatbots are expected to become even more sophisticated 
and capable of providing accurate and personalized medical advice. 
One significant area of development lies in improving the diagnostic accuracy of chatbots 
through enhanced AI algorithms and machine learning models. By leveraging large datasets of 
medical information, including electronic health records, clinical trials, and research papers, 
chatbots can refine their understanding of various diseases and symptoms, leading to more 
precise diagnoses.
